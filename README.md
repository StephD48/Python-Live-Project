# Python-Live-Project

## Introduction

This is a summary of all the projects I completed within my Python Live Project at The Tech Academy.
During the two weeks I worked with a team in creating an app on an interactive website for managing one's collections of 
things related to various hobbies as well as API and Data Scraping content for these hobbies. I did this using the Python and
Django framework, I also used HTML/CSS and SQlite.
