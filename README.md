# Python-Live-Project

## Introduction

This is a summary of all the projects I completed within my Python Live Project at The Tech Academy.
During the two weeks I worked on creating an app on an interactive website for managing one's collections of 
things related to various hobbies as well as API and Data Scraping content for these hobbies. I did this using the Python and
Django framework, I also used HTML/CSS and SQlite. During this project I gained experience with Azure DevOps. I participated in a sprint planning meeting,
daily stand-ups and a sprint restrospective.

In this project I used PyCharm to create my we application about Movie Reviews. I began creating this app by creating base and home templates in a new folder
using block tags and I also added functions to views that render the home page of the application. I also registered and created URLs for the apps homepage 
and linked app homepage by an image on the main application homepage. I created a navbar, footer, title and background using HTML,CSS, Bootstrap and Python.
I then created a functioning create page where the user can add their input that saves to the database through the create template rather than through 
an admin page. I added a function that retrieves the data in the database and displays the items in a template. This page renders with all of the items in the 
database with the movie titles and corresponding information related to each movie. I continued on by creating a details page and a function that will find
a single item in the database. I added a link for each item on the display all items page that directs to the details page for that item and displays the information 
on the details page. I added an edit and delete function that allows the user to edit and or delete any item in the database. It also a contains a conformation 
that the user wants to delete the item. I added data scraping with the use of Beautiful Soup. I did this by creating a new template for displaying the information 
sourced from another website to find the relevant information. I first printed the basic list to the terminal that contained the movie information extracted when 
the data scraping page loads.
